      <h6>Why was Angular 3 skipped:</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>@angular/core which is in a 2.X version</li>
        <li>@angular/http which is in a 2.X version</li>
        <li>@angular/compiler which is in a 2.X version</li>
        <li>@angular/rouer which is in a 3.X version</li>
      </ol>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Here @angular/router which is already in a 3.X version</p>
      <p>Now releasing Angular as version 3, with itâ€™s route on version 4 will create confusion.To avoid this confusion
        they decided to skip the version 3 and release with version 4.0.0, so that every major dependency in the
        MonoRepo are on the right track.</p>
